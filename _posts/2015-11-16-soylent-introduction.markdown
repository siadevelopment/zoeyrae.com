I will be the FIRST person to admit I eat like utter garbage. My diet is simply put ramen and Mtn. Dew (and a lot of it). I eat takeaway 2-3 times a week, and it puts a serious damper in my budget. Basically, My poor body gets most of its calories from soda and my frou-frou coffee drinks (Mochas - three shots espresso, steamed milk, chocolate sauce). My exercise is also pretty much non existant. I'm lazyness redefined when it comes to myself. So I'm going to change that (or try to anyway). I'm going to try Soylent for 30 days. I'm kind of a picky eater although recently I've branched out to new things, so hopefully this won't be an instant repulsion thing. Either you like soylent or you hate it.

I'm going to blog about it here for 30 days. I ordered enough for 14 days (eating two meals a day), and if things work out like I hope (do they ever?) I'll order another 14 days worth. Hell, this may turn into a forever (except special occasions) type deal. 

# What I hope for: #

- Feel less like garbage. I've noticed that the way I eat dramatically influences my anxiety and depression. 
- Get enough calories from food. Not from my liquid intake. This will help immensely no matter if I eat soylent, or actually cook proper meals. 
- Weigh t loss. Nothing dramatic, but I'm gaining weight because my body is always in starvation mode because a packet of ramen and a 2L of soda a day does not make a balanced diet. I'm also going to ramp up my exercise and that'll help too.


This experiment starts next week (The week of Nov. 22 (also my birthday week... Happy birthday to me!)) So Stay tuned, and maybe we'll learn something together. I'm also going to cut out soda, and try to limit myself to coffee only (no syrups or real sugar), and cut out 95% of my candy. Sometimes, you just need chocolate.

# My Thoughts on the bottled soylent #

I was going to go the premixed route, however browsing /r/soylent I saw a bunch of reports of mold in the bottles. So I'll be avoiding it for now. It looks cool, but I'd rather not drink moldy soylent.
