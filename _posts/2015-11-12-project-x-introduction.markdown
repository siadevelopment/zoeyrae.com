Project Z is something unexpected. Why should we be be forced to have our privacy invaded in order to have some algorithm decide what ads to show us that oftentimes aren't relevant? Practically any person with any basic tech knowledge knows what adblock is, and probably uses it to get rid of advertisements. Well, I'm out to change this.

Introducing Project Z. The first advertising platform where YOU choose the ads. I along with many other people would stop using adblockers if the advertising were relevant to the things we're interested in, and not having our privacy violated in the process. 

Project Z is simple, you log into the panel, and you see categories, you can assign each one a weight from 1-10 to get more relevant ads tailored to your browsing. That Amazon purchase you made that you wanted no one to know about suddenly filling up your ads showing the latest in kinky toys? No more! You can block that category, or any other for that matter and never see an ad like that again.

Development is starting soon, follow @zoeyrcluff, and http://github.com/zoeycluff/ProjectX for updates!
