I have a nifty little homelab setup that I use to tinker with to learn on. It's nothing special, and it's definately not "production" ready, but it's fun to learn on.

# Base Specs #


- CPU: AMD FX 8320
- Memory: 20GB (soon to be 32GB) DDR3-1600
- GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7770 (Only GPU I had laying around that worked.)
- Hard Drives: WD Green 2TB, WD Blue 1TB, WD Blue 500gb (Getting around to replacing them with matched drives soon)
- OS: VMWare ESXi 6

# What's on it? #

![ESXI]({{ site.url }}/images/esxi.jpg)

I use the ESXi box for testing for work, along with things I want to play with that can't be run locally. I'm in the process of spinning up new work VM's for prototyping to implement redundancy, and some cool projects (like redis)


# Windows VM's:#

- Two Active Directory Servers 
- Two DNS servers
- WSUS
- DHCP

# Linux VM's: #

- pfSense to act as a router to keep things separate
- Two DNS Servers
- A gateway VM to work on VM's that use the pfSense router so I can copy paste (something you can't do from the ESXi console sadly)

# Work Lab (Coming soon): #

- Two DNS servers
- Two Clustered MariaDB servers
- Two nginx machines
- HAProxy load balancer
- Redis (on trial to see if it speeds anything up)
- Puppet/Ansible (whatever one I pick)
- Logstash/Kibana/Elasticsearch

The work lab will eventually become production on Microsoft Azure (AWS I miss you!~). AWS is not my first pick, however Bizspark is quite nice and the Azure credits help.
