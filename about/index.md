So, I'll be the first to admit I'm bad at these things. I blogged extensively when I was younger then gave up for some unknown reason. I wish I could go back and read my old blog, just to see how far I've come since 2008/2009. I'm using this blog for daily musings (don't expect a lot of them as I'm terribly boring), as well as where I document work and personal projects that I'm working on. I'm not totally sure how often I'll update this, but I figured if I want a tech job, I should probably get a website. Now I just need business cards.... 

I'm 26 (almost), live in a not particularly nice part of Chicago, and I'm a college student first and foremost, and an IT jack/jill of all trades part time for work. I've been interested in computers since I could walk and talk, and tore apart and rebuilt my first pc when I was four or five years old. 

I've played with pretty much everything in the computer world, except programming. I don't know why, but that is the ONE thing I can't figure out. I've tried over and over again, and usually don't get very far. I'm doing a Coursera course to learn python, and I know a tiny bit about Ruby (which is why this is hosted with Jekyll. Why? Because why not just jump in head first?).
